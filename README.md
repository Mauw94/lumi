README will be edited upon as we plow through this adventure.
We shall see where this will bring us : )

## Examples
It might look like something like this in the future. Who knows.

```
lumi>3 * -5 --2
-13
```

```
lumi>1 to 5 every (*2)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

```
lumi>var vec = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
vec.sum()
15
```

- The goal is to add as much syntax sugar and quality-of-life stuff as possible.

## Features?
* Dynamically typed 
* Everything is an expression
* Classes and members?
* Lists `[a, b, c]`
* Dictionaries `{a, b, c }`
* For loops `for (a -> b)`
