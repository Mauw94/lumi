README will be edited upon as we plow through this adventure.
We shall see where this will bring us : )

## Examples
It might look like something like this in the future. Who knows.

```
lumi> 3 * -5 --2
-13
```

```
lumi> let a = 2;
lumi> print a;
2
```

```
lumi> let vec = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
lumi> vec.sum()
15
```

```
lumi> 1 to 5 every (*2)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```


## Features?
* Dynamically typed 
* Everything is an expression
* Classes and members?
* Lists `[a, b, c]`
* Dictionaries `{a: b, b: c}`
* For loops `1 to 5 step 1`
